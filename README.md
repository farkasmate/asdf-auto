[auto](https://github.com/farkasmate/asdf-auto) plugin for the [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com).

# tl;dr

Autoinstall `asdf` plugins and tools

Add optional plugin configuration in suffix comments:

```text
               # <git_url> [<git_ref>]
crystal 1.11.1 # https://github.com/farkasmate/asdf-crystal.git arm64
```

Install plugins and tools:

```shell
asdf auto
```

# y tho

It provides a stop-gap solution until we get first party plugin versioning support with `asdf`:

- <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/issues/166>
- <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/issues/1564>
- <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/issues/1678>

# Known issues

- It's a potential security risk if you run it on a malicious `.tool-versions` file
  - The potential is higher than just simply using `asdf`
  - It WILL install whatever is configured in the version file
- Call `asdf` commands on your behalf
  - [scripts should NOT call other asdf commands](https://asdf-vm.com/plugins/create.html#golden-rules-for-plugin-scripts)
- Mixes tool versions installed from different plugin versions
  - `jq 1.5` would install version `1.5` from <https://github.com/lsanwick/asdf-jq>
  - `jq 1.6 # https://github.com/bonzofenix/asdf-jq.git` would install from a [fork](https://github.com/bonzofenix/asdf-jq)
- Doesn't reinstall already installed versions (even if a different version of the plugin installed the it)
  - `jq 1.6` would not reinstall `jq` using the original repo if it's already installed by the fork
  - <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/issues/859>
  - <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/issues/244>
- It's similar but not the same as [asdf-plugin-manager](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-plugin-manager/tree/main)
  - You should check it out, it might do what you need
